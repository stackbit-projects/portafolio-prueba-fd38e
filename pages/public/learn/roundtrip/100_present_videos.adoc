Playing video on web pages seems not that special since you can already
watch videos on web pages through plugins like _Flash Player_, _Quicktime_,
or _Silverlight_. A new standard goes to HTML5 Video, a pure HTML way to
show video on the web, instead of the previous de facto standard of using
proprietary software.

== Video Galleries

HTML5 Video opens the doors to your way of presenting video content. Modern
browsers support the video tag `<video>` for the HTML5 video standard.
Browsers have a built-in multimedia framework already for decoding and displaying
video content. No need to use such proprietary software components anymore!

HTML5 Video support is given by the App gallery combined with the Lightbox
LightGallery.

Two types of video sources are supported:

. videos from local files (your webspace)
. videos from online sources (on the Internet) like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

The combination of the App gallery and the lightbox LightGallery is entirely
usable for all the video content you want to present on your site. Galleries
can be placed elsewhere with your content. You can use them for video blogs
by putting them into your blog article's  content.

WARNING: LightGallery can be used for free for private use, but a commercial
license is needed for business use. See link:{light-gallery-license}[Light Gallery license]
how to use LightGallery for commercial websites and projects.

== Local video content

Digital image content, simple pictures or videos, are easy to make. Today, each
and every mobile has a camera - not that bad! Presenting a bunch
of (digital) pictures is very easy by using Justified Gallery, for example.
Videos created by a digicam or a mobile can be played by J1 Template using the
HTML5 Video support of LightGallery.

Two players are available with LightGallery:

. an internal player used by default
. http://videojs.com/[video.js], a excellent Javascript video library

NOTE: The HTML5 specification does _not_ define which video and audio formats
browsers _should_ support. J1 LightGallery can play all types of standard
HTML5 Video formats on modern browsers today (MP4, WebM, and Ogg).

== Online video content

The Internet is full of inspiring content. Video content is popular,
the number of channels on _YouTube_ is enormous. If you want to present
video content from the Internet, e.g., your channel, the online video
support of J1 Template may be the right choice. Find some enjoyable videos
from James Cordon's channel: Carpool Karaoke.

== Whats next

Images and videos are pretty visual. And it can be impressive, for sure.
But the most visual component is the text for all pages, for all sites on the
Internet. To see how text could be presented great for modern responsive
websites, check the section Typography next.
