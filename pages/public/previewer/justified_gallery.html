                                        To create modern image and video galleries, J1 Template implements
                                        the jQuery plugin JustifiedGallery. The module is a great tool to
                                        create responsive, infinite, and high quality justified image galleries.
                                        See Justified Gallery in action - and for sure all that you see is even
                                        responsive. Change the e.g. the size of your current browser window,
                                        by width or height. From the config menu, some basic features of Justified
                                        Gallery can be changed online.
                                        See what will happen!
