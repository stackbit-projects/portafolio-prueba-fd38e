|Attribute |Description

|`rouge-css`
|Controls what method is used for applying CSS to the tokens.
Can be `class` (CSS classes), `style` (inline styles) or `external` (external styles).
When `class` is used, Rouge styles for the specified theme are included in an HTML header.
When `external` is specified, CSS classes are used but no styles will be added except
when `rouge-theme` is not empty in which case its value is interpreted as a URL to a
style sheet and a link to that style sheet will be added to the HTML header.
Default is `class`.

|`rouge-theme`
|Sets the name of the Rouge color theme to use.
Look into https://github.com/jneen/rouge/tree/master/lib/rouge/themes[lib/rouge/themes]
in the Rouge repository for a list of available themes.
Default is `github`.

|`rouge-style`
|Alternative name for the `rouge-theme` for compatibility with
_asciidoctor-pdf_.

|`rouge-highlighted-class`
|CSS class to use on a line wrapper element for highlighted lines.
Default is `highlighted`.

|`rouge-line-class`
|CSS class to set on a line wrapper element
Default is `line`.

|`rouge-line-id`
|Format string for specifying an HTML `id` for each line (e.g. with
`rouge-line-id="L%i"` each line of the listing will get an id of the
form `id="L1"`, `id="L2"`, etc.). This really only makes sense if the
format string is distinct for each source listing, otherwise it will
lead to duplicate IDs which makes the generated HTML invalid.
Default is no line ids.
